# mnist-scan

This program does four things:
1. Creates a dataset by stitching together various MNIST images randomly.
2. Classifies MNIST dataset with over 99% accuracy (neural network #1)
3. Determines if a digit is centered or not (neural network #2)
4. Scans over a stitched together image, finds centered digits, and classifies the digit.

The entire process can be viewed below. The code for generating this image can be found in
